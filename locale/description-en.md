# UCP2-Legacy: Revised AI Files
In this plugin, you get most of the files, that were available in UCP2, and which are also compatible with most of the available AI behaviour plugins.
Based on this Plugin, you can enable full sets of castles and one ai patched behaviour by enabeling these other plugins:
  - UCP2-Legacy: Patched AI Behaviour
  - Vanilla Fixed Castles
  - Evrey Castles
  - Tatha Castles

NOTE: Other AI behaviour plugins, like the Xander10alpha AI Overhaul and the Krarilotus Aggressive AIC, and many more castle packs and behaviour enhancing plugins are found separate from this basic plugin, and will be receiving regular updates.

## Vanilla Fixed Castles
The Vanilla Fixed Castles, formerly known as "Evrey-Fixed" was updated by Xander10alpha to be more compatible with plugins that modify the AIs behaviour.
It features all of the original castles, with slightly updated buildorder, more housing and adjusted storage capacity for wares, weapons and food, to fit all necessary goods for the vanilla AIs.

## Evrey Castles
The Evrey Castles feature unique designs, which were inspired by the original vanilla AIs with some added perks. The castles were updated by Xander10alpha to be more compatible with plugins that modify the AIs behaviour.
The castles alter the shape and sometimes the economy of the AIs, where they also come with more housing and an updated buildorder as well as an adjusted storage capacity.
The Wolf e.g. uses positive fearfactor to enhance the strength of his troops in exchange for economy and the Abbot build a cross-shaped castle.

## Tatha Castles
The Tatha Castles feature a strengthened defensive design and are an overhaul in terms of the economy compared to the vanilla castles. The castles were updated by Xander10alpha to be more compatible with plugins that modify the AIs behaviour.
The castles are completely reshaped and got an updated buildorder, more housing space as well as an adjsuted storage capacity to fit all necessary wares for the vanilla AIs.

## UCP2-Legacy: Patched AI Behaviour
The patched AI behaviour fixes the most blatent issues in the AIs ability to manage its economy, fixing bugs. It also includes some fixes in the AIs starting troops, which make sure, they don't get stuck on no ranged defensive units in the "Crusader" game mode. The AI is still left pretty much in its vanilla state besides that.
